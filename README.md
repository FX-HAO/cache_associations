# CacheAssociations

CacheAssociations is a simple cache implementation to make Low-Level caching collaborate with Association caching.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cache_associations'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cache_associations

## Usage

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include CacheAssociations

  has_one :profile
  cache_association :profile do 
    # put your cache name here
    [self.class.name, id, 'profile', update_at.to_i]
  end
end

class Profile < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user, touch: true
end
```

The `cache_association` defines a method `cached_profile` to fetch data from the cache store.
And `cache_association` accepts a block to define the cache name, it's `[self.class.name, id, name, updated_at.to_i]` in default.

```ruby
irb> u = User.take
irb> u.cached_profile # fetch from the cache store
irb> u.profile # fetch the cached version
irb> u.profile.reload # refetch from the database
  Profile Load (1.4ms) SELECT  "profiles".* FROM "profiles" WHERE "profiles"."user_id" = $1 LIMIT $2  [["id", 1], ["LIMIT", 1]]
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
